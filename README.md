# Final Assignment
The goal of the final assignment is to apply the coding skills you have learned to address an interesting biological question, details will be posted in the coming weeks, but expect the following:

* Analyze a large dataset (>1000 data points); original or published data are fine (e.g. geospatial data, RNA-seq/gene expression data)
* Write custom scripts using a combination of (1) Bash and (2) R or Python (or both)
* Produce informative and elegant visualizations
* All data manipulation, analysis and visualization hard-coded and archived on GitHub
* Project addresses an interesting biological question
* Create a poster for the project, and present it at the Biology graduate student symposium (April 20)
